code-challenge-1
Description

This project contains three beginner-friendly JavaScript coding challenges designed to practice user input handling, basic arithmetic calculations, and console output formatting.

Each challenge is implemented in its own folder and is self-contained. These programs are interactive and use `prompt()` to receive input and display results using `console.log()`.

##  Challenges Overview

### 1. Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator 

1 Prompts the user for the number of cups of chai.
2 Calculates the ingredients needed based on a standard recipe per cup.
3 Outputs the required amounts for water, milk, tea leaves, and sugar.

### 2. Boda Boda Ride Fare Estimator 

1 Prompts the user for the distance of the ride in kilometers.
2 Uses a base fare of KES 50 and KES 15 per km to compute the total.
3 Outputs a detailed fare breakdown.

### 3. Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator 

1 Prompts the user for the amount they want to send.
2 Calculates a transaction fee as 1.5% of the amount.
  - Fee is minimum KES 10, maximum KES 70.
3 Displays the fee and the total amount to be debited.

##  How to Run

These scripts are written for browser-based environments (they use `prompt()`):

1. Open the `.js` files in a browser environment.
   You can paste them into your browser's **Developer Console** or tools like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), [CodePen](https://codepen.io), or [Repl.it](https://replit.com).
2. Follow the on-screen prompts and view the output in the console.
